1: Code location:
    All my codes are in 'Main.ipynb'
2: How to use it:
    2-1: Open my project by Jupyter Notebook
    2-2: Open 'Main.ipynb' file
    2-3: Click 'Kernel' -> 'Restart & Run All' -> 'Restart and Run All Cells'
    2-4: All graphs will be shown at the end of the file 
    2-5: Also, graphs will be saved as a .png file in the project folder
3: What I use in the project:
    For my interest, I use Seaborn to generate W4 and W5 graphs.
    But for W3 ones, I only use Seaborn to set-up figure style by sns.setup()
4: What if the graph cannot be generated correctly:
    If there is any problem on generating the graphs please contact me via Email :)
